# Project Overview

This project consists of 3 deliverables:

- Deliverable 1: Retrieve weather data from OpenWeatherMap API using randomized coordinates.
- Deliverable 2: Create interactive application where a user can input desired temperature range and generate a map listing hotels that meet the weather criteria.
- Deliverable 3: Create a travel itinerary map showing directions between 4 cities listed in the prior application.

# Results

## Deliverable 1
This deliverable is contained in the Weather_Database folder. It consists of the Jupyter Notebook used to generate the random coordinates as well as the API call to pull the weather details. The 743 results are output into the contained Weather_Py_Database.csv file. 

## Deliverable 2
This deliverable is contained in the Vacation_Search folder. It consists of the Jupyter Notebook containing the API call identify and map hotels for each of the random coordinates output from the first deliverable. the 736 results are output in to the contained WeatherPy_Vacation.csv file. There is also a screenshot of the interactive map of the hotels.

## Deliverable 3
This deliverable is contained in the Vacation_Itinerary folder. it consists of the Jupyter Notebook containing the API to map directions between the four selected cities. it also contains screenshots of the generated maps.
